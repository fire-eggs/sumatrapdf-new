# This is a proposition for how to make SumatraPDF more
# configurable without having to add further command line
# options or complicating the UI (similar to Mozilla's
# about:config).

# Such a file would deprecate the command line options over
# two release versions and would allow to eventually clean
# up sumatrapdfprefs.dat (those values could be migrated to
# SumatraPDF-user.ini at first startup).

# To apply this configuration, copy this file into
# the same directory as sumatrapdfprefs.dat or SumatraPDF.exe.

# ReuseInstance: when set to a nonzero value, opening a new
# document should happen in an already running SumatraPDF
# instance so that there's only one process and documents

# Default Value: 0

# EscToExit: when set to a nonzero value, the Esc key will
# exit SumatraPDF same as 'q'

[ForwardSearch]

# highlight will remain visible until the next mouse click instead of fading
# away instantly
# Default value: 0

# EnableTeXEnhancements: when set to a nonzero value, the inverse search
# command line can be set from the settings dialog
